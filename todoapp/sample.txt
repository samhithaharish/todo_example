Hello all,
 
These are the tasks I will be completing today:
 
I will start with App creation at 9:00 hrs. The App will have all the aspects that we discussed like login page, ectraction of data from a text file, putting it into a database and finally showing them on the dash board.
 
Then I will have my lunch at 13:00. I am planning to order my lunch on Swiggy app.
 
 
Regards,
Samhitha
